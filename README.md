# OES Theme
Welcome to the Open Encyclopedia System (OES) Theme repository on GitHub.  
OES is a modular and configurable software platform for creating, publishing, and maintaining online encyclopedias in the humanities and social sciences. It is designed to be accessible worldwide through Open Access.

The **OES Theme** serves as an exemplary block theme designed for an OES project plugin.
